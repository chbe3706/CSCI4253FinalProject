This is my final project for CSCI4253 it is a Network Analyzer. 
This program runs similarly to our Lab-7 where in my case you must launch this on the google cloud to active correctly

To get started pull this repository to your cloud console
Next execute the launcher.sh
  This will activate all the Kubernetes pods, services, and ingress. 
  
 I have not tested this on any account other than mine, so your results may vary depending on your account settings. 
    If you need help running this project please contact me and I will assist you, or prove that this works for grading purposes.
